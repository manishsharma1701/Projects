### 🚀 Key Projects

> **Note to recruiters:** Many of my projects, including coursework assignments, involve proprietary or academic code. I am happy to discuss the methodologies and my contributions in detail.

* **[Mesh Adaptation for RANS Problems](link-to-repo)**
    *Used PRAVAHA, HIFUN, and CFD++ to perform mesh adaptation, including validating meshes against NASA's TMR website.
* **[CNN-based Aerodynamics Prediction](link-to-repo)**
    * Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that predicts lift ($C_L$) and drag ($C_D$) coefficients from an airfoil's shape and flow conditions.
* **[Hypersonic Flow Solver](link-to-repo)**
    * Implemented a Python-based solver for the Taylor-Macoll equation using a modified Newton's method to analyze hypersonic flow over a cone.
* **[Turbomachinery Cascade Analysis](link-to-repo)**
    * Developed a vortex panel method code to analyze flow through a turbomachine cascade.
